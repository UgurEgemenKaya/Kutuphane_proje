"# Kutuphane_proje - Library_Project" 


For this project I have used Python, Django, HTML, CSS, SQLite.

You can perform followings at this project: 

  1) Admin operations
  2) User operations
  3) Browsing Books & Leaving Comments on them
  4) Borrowing books & returning them
 
Note that; I have used a CSS template but made changes (adjusted/redesigned some parts) on it to fit my code.
